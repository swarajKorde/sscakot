Korpe and Late B. B. Bhende. Akot thluka is famous for cotton production. During 1960, above six thousand cotton loaded bullock-carts were brought by farmers in market. Above members requested each farmer to donate one rupee per cart and farmers who were starving for higher education also responded to the mission enthusinastically and collected 3 lakh rupees and doneted it to the society. Dr. J.N.Korpe generously donated the building of freedom fighter Shri Govindsingh Killedar which was owned by Janpad sabha. He also donated Rs.10,000/- to begin the college. Thus the faculty of Arts began in 1960, Commerce in 1962 and Science in 1980. Since 1960 the college has received ample response from society and made rapid progress in education field.
